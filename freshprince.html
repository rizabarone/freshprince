		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
		<p> From western Philadelphia I hail
		   where in my youth I'd play upon the green
		   'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
	  	   by ruffians contemptible and mean.
           Although the spat was trivial and brief,
           it wounded my dear mother deep within;
           and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
           she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
           When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
           I came upon a coachman most unique;
           and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
           despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
           I survey all the land with princely mien
           in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
